## Welcome to my Profile!

> "Just a kid trying to survive and not end up homeless... but I write code too."

I'm a Computer Science & Data Science student at the University of Michigan, building things that (hopefully) don't crash. I love bringing ideas to life with code, especially in the worlds of systems programming, data-driven apps, and web development. I'm always looking for ways to learn more, build smarter, and contribute to meaningful projects.
