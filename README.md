# 👋 Hey, I'm [Your Name]

I'm a systems-oriented developer who loves working close to the metal. Passionate about operating systems, distributed systems, and writing clean, efficient code.

I enjoy solving complex problems with elegant solutions — whether it’s debugging pipeline hazards in a simulator or building robust backends that can scale.
